## MindEvolve
### Summary
The MindEvolve project seeks to revolutionize anxiety disorder treatment by utilizing virtual reality as a therapeutic tool. By immersing users in a simulated café environment, the project aims to provide individuals, aged 14 to 18, suffering from anxiety disorders with a controlled space to confront and conquer their anxiety. Through interactive scenarios and a user-friendly interface, MindEvolve aims to familiarize users with the café ordering process and the environment, empowering them to build confidence and alleviate anxiety. 
### Project Aim
The project goal is a therapeutic tool VR to help individuals live an anxiety-free life. The user will be able to walk around the environment, manipulate objects and interact with the café staff. Through repeated exposure to social interactions and the ordering process within the virtual café, users can build confidence and develop coping mechanisms that translate to real-world scenarios.
### Features
#### •	Virtual Café Environment: Detailed 3D models, textures, and audio create an immersive café experience.
#### •	Interactive Ordering System: Users can practice the ordering process through interactions.
#### •	Scenario-based Social Interaction: Simulate real-world café interactions with servers/baristas and placing orders.
#### •	User-Friendly Interface: Navigation and interactions tailored for users with anxiety disorders.
#### •	Teleportation System: Seamlessly move between café and forest environments to minimize discomfort.
#### •	Realistic Character Creation: Lifelike barista character with animations for engaging interactions.
#### •	AI Voice Generator: LOVO provides voice interactions to enhance user engagement.
#### •	Forest Relaxation Environment: Escape to a serene forest environment for relaxation and tranquility.
### Controls
MindEvolve uses controls compatible with the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. To navigate through the environment, teleportation is used to minimize any discomfort, resulting in motion sickness. Users can manipulate with objects and interact with the café server using controllers.
### Journey
#### Challenge 1: Barista Character
Creating a lifelike barista character with convincing animations presented hurdles in the beginning of the project.
Solution: Through many hours of self-study and multiple iterations and alternate versions using 3D character creation and animation tools, I developed a barista character that came to life. Rigorous testing and iterations of animations ensured realistic interactions, enhancing user engagement.
#### Challenge 2: Realism and Immersion
Creating an immersive café environment situated in a forest demanded attention to detail in 3D models, textures, and audio. My attempt was to create an immersive environment for users to practice the ordering process and relax in the forest if they will uncomfortable during the experience.
Solution: In the initial stages of creating a virtual environment, a comprehensive conceptualization and planning phase is essential to lay the foundation for a truly immersive experience. A rough layout or blueprint of the environment was outlined. This blueprint acts as a skeletal framework, indicating the spatial arrangement and pathways within the virtual environment. It provides a clear map for the development process. During the environment building phase, there were still many alternate versions to create a virtual environment as realistic as possible.
#### Challenge 3: Dialogue System
While the dialogue system was successfully implemented in a third-person perspective, adapting it to work within the immersive VR environment presented unique obstacles.
Solution: Lots of iterations and testing have gone through, and I will continue explore other methods to demonstrate the concepts.

### Roadmap / Beyond 
The MindEvolve project is more than just a virtual reality experience; it's an evolving journey towards enhanced mental well-being for individuals with anxiety disorders. As I look ahead, my roadmap encompasses a range of developments and expansions that will further elevate the impact of MindEvolve.

#### 1. Expansion of Scenarios
Beyond the ordering food scenario, I envision creating additional scenarios such as chatting with customers, dining with restaurants, etc. These environments will offer diverse scenarios, enabling users to practice social interactions in various contexts.
#### 2. Enhanced Interactions with Users
Expanding the depth of interactions with virtual characters and having an extensive and flexible dialogues are priorities. I will also work on incorporating more realistic dialogues and responses and having a virtual character within the environment to guide the user along the process. For example, displaying messages or having a virtual character checking on the user’s feelings during the experience.
